title: Are You A Mexican't or a Mexican'tNot?

explain: |
	Or: `can'tNot` can `can't`; `can't` can't `can'tNot`!

	Remember these two rules:

		1: a → ⊥
		¬a	|can't 1

		2: ¬a → ⊥
		a	|can'tNot 2

	In the last few exercises we've used `can'tNot` instead of `can't`.
	It's more complicated!
	But it does things that `can't`, well, can't.
	For example, *Double Negation Elimination*
		(see ["No Baby No"](/exercise/NoBabyNo)).

	`can't` is only good for adding negations - `can'tNot` can remove them.

	Now, prove that using `can'tNot`, you can do what you could with `can't`.

setup: |
	contradiction a: a, ¬a ⇒
		⊥
	can'tNot a: ¬a → ⊥ ⇒
		a

	declare zionistConspiracy

	isCrazy: zionistConspiracy → ⊥

answer: |
	unlessNot: ¬¬zionistConspiracy ⇒
		unless: ¬zionistConspiracy ⇒
			⊥	|contradiction unless#1 unlessNot#1
		plain: zionistConspiracy	|can'tNot unless
		⊥	|isCrazy plain
	¬zionistConspiracy	|can'tNot unlessNot

finish: |
	assert proven: ¬zionistConspiracy

hint: |
	`can'tNot` always removes one negation.
	So to get to one negation, start with two:

		unlessNot: ¬¬zionistConspiracy ⇒
			...
			⊥	|_
		¬zionistConspiracy	|_
