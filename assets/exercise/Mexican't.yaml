title: Are You A Mexican't or a Mexican'tNot?

explain: |
	Or: "Can't Not" can "Can't"; "Can't" can't "Can't Not"!

	In the last few exercises we've used `can'tNot` instead of `can't`.
	Granted, it's more complicated. But it does things that `can't`, well, can't.

	You may want to look back at "No Baby No";
		you will need to do a *Double Negation Elimination* here, too.

setup: |
	contradiction a: a, ¬a ⇒
		⊥
	can'tNot a: ¬a → ⊥ ⇒
		a

	declare zionistConspiracy

	isCrazy: zionistConspiracy → ⊥

answer: |
	unlessNot: ¬¬zionistConspiracy ⇒
		unless: ¬zionistConspiracy ⇒
			⊥	|contradiction unless#1 unlessNot#1
		plain: zionistConspiracy	|can'tNot unless
		⊥	|isCrazy plain
	¬zionistConspiracy	|can'tNot unlessNot

finish: |
	assert proven: ¬zionistConspiracy

hint: |
	`can'tNot` always removes one negation.
	So to get to one negation, start with two:

		unlessNot: ¬¬zionistConspiracy ⇒
			...
			⊥	|_
		¬zionistConspiracy	|_
