title: Slippery in Seattle

explain: |
	Some statements are implied by others.
	They are called *implication*s.
	For example:

		rainy → wet

	Every time we know `rainy`, we know `wet`.

	We represent this like so:

		implication: rainy → wet
		premise: rainy
		wet |implication premise

	This is a new type of justification: one that takes an *argument*.
	In this case, the argument must be a line whose contents
	equal the left side of the implication (`rainy`).

setup: |
	declare rainy wet slippery

	rainIsWater: rainy → wet
	waterIsSlippery: wet → slippery
