title: Nope Nope Nope

explain: |
	What if I like it big and wordy?
	What if I like to say stupid stuff like "not unlike"?
	Prove that I'm not wrong!

	This would be a lot easier if I gave you `can't`,
		but instead, I give you `can'tNot`.
	Since `can'tNot` removes negations,
		you'll have to start with three of them and work your way down!

	By the way, this is called
		[Double Negation Introduction](
		http://www.proofwiki.org/wiki/Double_Negation/Double_Negation_Introduction).

setup: |
	contradiction a: a, ¬a ⇒
		⊥
	can'tNot a: ¬a → ⊥ ⇒
		a

	declare alike

	plain: alike

answer: |
	neg3: ¬¬¬alike ⇒
		neg2: ¬¬alike ⇒
			⊥	|contradiction neg2#1 neg3#1
		not: ¬alike	|can'tNot neg2
		⊥	|contradiction plain not
	¬¬alike	|can'tNot neg3

finish: |
	assert proven: ¬¬alike

hint: |
	Use:

		neg3: ¬¬¬alike ⇒
			neg2: ¬¬alike ⇒
				⊥ |_
			¬alike |_
			⊥
		¬¬alike	|_
