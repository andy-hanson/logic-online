title: With Equality and Logic for All

explain: |
	When two statements are both true or both false, we call them *equal*.
	They of course both mean different things; as do `2 + 2` and `4`.
	What matters is that *evaluating* the statements produces the same result.

		same: a = b
		one: a
		other: b	||same one
		a			||same other

	As you can see, an equality acts like a two-way implication.
	In fact, an equality is equivalent to a two-way implication!
	Over the next few exercises, you'll prove it.
	This time: prove that an equality implies a two-way implication.

setup: |
	declare logic cool

	raisonDEtre: logic = cool

answerSetup: |


answer: |
	forth: logic ⇒
		cool	|raisonDEtre forth#1

	back: cool ⇒
		logic	|raisonDEtre back#1

finish: |
	assert proven: logic → cool
	assert proven: cool → logic

hint: |
	Suppose logic, get cool.
	Suppose cool, get logic.
