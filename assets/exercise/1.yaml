setup: |
	\ This describes repeat within our language.
	repeat a: a ⇒
		a

	\ This says that x is a Boolean we can refer to.
	\ Unlike a, it can take on only one value.
	declare x

	\ Here is our premise.
	\ We give it the *label* "yesX" so we can refer to it later.
	yesX: x

	\ Now let's use that premise.
	\ This line is *justified* by the rule "repeat" applied to the line "yesX".
	revengeOfX: x	|repeat yesX

answer: |
	xRidesAgain: x	|repeat yesX

finish: |
	\ You'll have to make a line labeled "xRidesAgain", or this will fail.
	x	|repeat xRidesAgain

hint: |
	The answer is "xRidesAgain: x	|repeat yesX".
