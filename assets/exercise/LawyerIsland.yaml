title: Lawyer Island

explain: |
	All this deduction is tiring!
	You decide to go on vacation.
	Unfortunately, your plane was built illogically,
	and you crash on an uncharted island.

	Around here, everything is upside-down.
	Lawyers roam the land looking for an honest day's work.
	They are courteous, respectful, and always tell the truth.

	You meet two trustworthy-looking people and ask them if they are lawyers.

	Alice says, "Bob is a lawyer."

	Bob says, "If Alice is a lawyer, I'm not."

	Looks like you won't get that vacation after all.
	You puzzle it over but just can't figure it out.
	Deduction to the rescue!

	You represent truthfulness with variables: `alice`, `bob`.
	You represent claims with implication:
		if alice claims Bob is truthful, `alice → bob`.

	Now, decide whether alice is telling the truth.
	(To *decide* a statement is to prove or disprove it.)

setup: |
	contradiction a: a, ¬a  ⇒
		⊥
	can't a: a → ⊥ ⇒
		¬a

	declare alice bob

	\ According to Alice, Bob is a lawyer.
	soSaysAlice: alice → bob

	\ According to Bob, if Alice is a lawyer, he isn't.
	soSaysBob: bob → (alice → ¬bob)

answer: |
	ifAlice: alice ⇒
		1: bob			|soSaysAlice ifAlice#1
		2: alice → ¬bob	|soSaysBob 1
		3: ¬bob			|2 ifAlice#1
		⊥				|contradiction 1 3

	¬alice	|can't ifAlice

finish: |
	assert decided: alice

hint: |
	Suppose that alice is telling the truth.
	You'll get a contradiction.
	Any one who claims a contradiction is no lawyer, that's for sure!
	In other words:

		ifAlice: alice ⇒
			...
			⊥	|_

		¬alice	|can't ifAlice
