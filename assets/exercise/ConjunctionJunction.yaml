title: Conjunction Junction

explain: |
	Sometimes you know more than one thing.
	(I sure hope so.)
	If you do, you can represent it with `∧`:

		a ∧ b

	(Hold `Alt` and press `^` to type `∧`.)

	This is called a *conjunction*.
	It is a one-line equivalent of putting them on different lines:

		a \ and also
		b

	You'll need a few rules to convert between the two formats.
	`conjunct` takes two lines and puts them in a conjunction.
	`unConjunctL` and `unConjunctR` take the conjunction and split it back into lines.

	Today, Mario and Luigi are arguing over who gets top billing.
	Prove that the two are logically equivalent.

setup: |
	conjunct a b: a, b ⇒
		a ∧ b
	unConjunctL a b: a ∧ b ⇒
		a
	unConjunctR a b: a ∧ b ⇒
		b

	declare starsMario starsLuigi

	original: starsMario ∧ starsLuigi

answer: |
	m: starsMario			|unConjunctL original
	l: starsLuigi			|unConjunctR original
	starsLuigi ∧ starsMario	|conjunct l m

finish: |
	assert proven: starsLuigi ∧ starsMario

hint: |
	First, `unConjunct` the brothers apart.
	Then `conjunct` them back together in the opposite order.
